# Tagging Playbook (Track C)

## Goal
Standardize tagging so content is filterable and comparable.

## Deliverables
- Controlled vocabulary: e.g. assemblage, schizoanalysis, affect, war machine, deterritorialization.
- Rules for assigning tags (primary/secondary, disambiguation).
- CSV column spec and QA checklist.

## Inputs Needed
- Preferred tag list from team (or seed list proposed here).

## Stretch Ideas
- Link tags to concept maps on the website.
- Auto-suggest tags based on text scan.
