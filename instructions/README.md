This folder contains modular instruction tracks for the project.  
Each page provides goals, deliverables, inputs, and stretch ideas.

- [Tagging Playbook](./tagging_playbook.md)
- [Comparative Scholars Track](./comparative_track.md)

Use these tracks as building blocks: choose one, expand, refine, and implement.
