# Comparative Scholars Track (Track D)

## Goal
Provide instructions for adding parallel datasets (e.g., Massumi, Colebrook, Braidotti).

## Deliverables
- Data schema alignment guide (so multiple scholars fit same model).
- Curation rules (handling translations, editions, duplicates).
- Guidelines for “Selected works” across different scholars.

## Inputs Needed
- First two comparison scholars to target.

## Stretch Ideas
- Comparative visualizations (Buchanan vs peers).
- Cross-tagging shared concepts.
