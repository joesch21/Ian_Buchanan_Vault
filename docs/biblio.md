# Bibliography & Formatting

These pages provide ORCID-powered bibliography tools and simple formatting exports.

- Visit `/bibliography` to explore works, import CSV data, tag concepts, and create wikitext blocks.
- Visit `/formatting` to render selected items in various citation styles and copy export snippets.

The proxy server reads ORCID data and normalizes it for the frontend store.
