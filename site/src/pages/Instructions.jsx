            This graph is not a family tree or a linear timeline. It is a <span className="highlight">rhizome</span>:
            a network of connections without hierarchy. Each time you compile the graph, you generate a
            <span className="highlight"> cartography</span> â€” a map of relations in motion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of each node (scholar, work, concept) as a <span className="highlight">component of an assemblage</span>.
            Edges trace intensities: how concepts like <span className="highlight">assemblage</span>, affect, or becoming circulate across texts.
